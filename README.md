# How to install

- Unpack the sounds zip file into your _retail_ World of Warcraft Interface folder. The final MP3 files should be placed in a similar path (depending on where your WoW is installed): ```C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\CustomSounds\shaman``` 
- Import WeakAura from weakaura text files
